>>python mpl_figure_editor.py

It saves the images to the images/ folder in this directory

I use the Yahoo Image Search API provided here: http://developer.yahoo.com/search/image/V1/imageSearch.html , and the file is YahooParser.py

It breaks for some images, but these work for sure:

pikachu
google
happy
hello
goodbye
Monty Python, humour
