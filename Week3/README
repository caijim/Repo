1. For question 1, I ran Chris Klein's server (xmlrpc_server_by_chris_klein.py) . I take moonlanding.png and run it through image_distort_1, image_distort_2, and image_distort_3 in that order. Then in the same order, I run the reverse algorithms. 

2. I didn't have much time to do question 2, so what you see is a shoddy attempt :(
